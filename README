## Project Summary 
The purpose of this inference engine is infer which medication would be appropriate to take, given a set of inputted symptoms.

All information in the data sets of symptoms and medications are based on medical information gathered from a research study.

## How To Use
1. Open the multi-select dropdown to select the symptoms that you are experiencing.
2. Select "infer" to display the results
3. The pie chart will represent the percentage chance that any given medication will be able to treat the symptoms you entered. 
    * Clicking a medication on the pie chart will bring you to the associated webMD page for more information on that medication 
4. Clicking "yes" to on "Did you take another drug for these exact symptoms?", allows you to enter a drug that was effective against the current set of symptoms you submitted, which gets entered into the DB and thus allows the inference engine to "Learn"
